#### **Blank Line Strategy**
All fields use the `drawField()` helper function which:
- Shows data if available
- Draws underline for manual entry if data is missing
- Maintains consistent field widths
- Preserves form structure even with missing data

#### **Example:**
```javascript
drawField(x, y, claim.data || '', width)
// If claim.data exists: Shows the data with underline
// If claim.data is missing: Shows just the underline for manual entry
```

#### **Layout Elements**
- Main border around entire form
- Checkboxes (3x3 units)
- Underlined fields for data entry
- Text wrapping for long descriptions
- Proper margins and padding

#### **Checkboxes**
```javascript
drawCheckbox(x, y, isChecked)
// Draws empty box if false
// Draws box with checkmark (✓) if true
```

### 5. Data Extraction
