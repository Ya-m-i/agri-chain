# Socket.IO Logout Disconnection Fix

## Problem
The Socket.IO clients were not properly disconnecting when users logged out from both admin and farmer sides. This meant that even after logout, the socket connections remained active on the server, causing potential security issues and resource leaks.

## Root Cause
The logout functions in both admin and farmer dashboards only called the Zustand `logout()` function and navigated to the login page, but didn't handle Socket.IO client disconnection.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Auth Store (`authStore.js`)
- **Updated logout function** to include socket disconnection
- **Added proper room cleanup** before disconnecting
- **Included localStorage cleanup** for backward compatibility
- **Added error handling** for socket operations

```javascript
logout: () => {
  // Disconnect socket before clearing auth state
  try {
    const currentUser = useAuthStore.getState().user;
    const currentUserType = useAuthStore.getState().userType;
    
    if (currentUser?.id && currentUserType) {
      const room = currentUserType === 'admin' ? 'admin-room' : `farmer-${currentUser.id}`;
      console.log('Logout: Leaving room:', room);
      socketManager.leaveRoom(room);
    }
    
    console.log('Logout: Disconnecting socket...');
    socketManager.disconnect();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during socket cleanup on logout:', error);
  }
  
  // Clear localStorage and auth state
  localStorage.removeItem("isAdmin");
  localStorage.removeItem("isFarmer");
  set({ isAuthenticated: false, userType: null, user: null });
}
```

### 2. Improved Socket Manager (`socket.js`)
- **Enhanced disconnect method** with proper logging
- **Added handleUserLogout method** for comprehensive cleanup
- **Improved leaveRoom method** with connection checks

```javascript
// Enhanced disconnect with logging
disconnect() {
  if (this.socket) {
    console.log('SocketManager: Disconnecting socket...');
    this.listeners.clear();
    this.socket.disconnect();
    this.socket = null;
    this.isConnected = false;
    console.log('SocketManager: Socket disconnected successfully');
  }
}

// New method for user logout cleanup
handleUserLogout(userType, userId) {
  try {
    if (userId && userType) {
      const room = userType === 'admin' ? 'admin-room' : `farmer-${userId}`;
      this.leaveRoom(room);
    }
    this.disconnect();
    console.log('SocketManager: User logout cleanup completed');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SocketManager: Error during logout cleanup:', error);
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Socket Query Hook (`useSocketQuery.js`)
- **Added authentication state monitoring** to disconnect on logout
- **Enhanced cleanup on component unmount**
- **Proper initialization flag management**

```javascript
// Cleanup on user change
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.id) {
    const room = userType === 'admin' ? 'admin-room' : `farmer-${user.id}`;
    socketManager.joinRoom(room);
  } else {
    // User logged out - disconnect socket
    if (isInitializedRef.current) {
      console.log('useSocketQuery: User logged out, disconnecting socket...');
      socketManager.disconnect();
      isInitializedRef.current = false;
    }
  }
}, [user?.id, userType]);
```

### 4. New Socket Auth Hook (`useSocketAuth.js`)
- **Created dedicated hook** for managing socket connection lifecycle
- **Handles authentication state changes** automatically
- **Manages room joining/leaving** based on user type
- **Provides proper cleanup** on component unmount

### 5. Updated Dashboard Components
- **AdminDashboard**: Updated `handleLogout` to use enhanced auth store logout
- **FarmerDashboard**: Updated `handleLogout` to use enhanced auth store logout
- **Enhanced components**: Added proper logging and cleanup

### 6. Enhanced App.jsx
- **Added useSocketAuth hook** for comprehensive socket management
- **Enhanced logging** to track socket connection and room status

## Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Socket Disconnection
- Socket automatically disconnects when user logs out
- Proper room cleanup before disconnection
- Works for both admin and farmer users

### ✅ Authentication State Monitoring
- Socket connection tied to authentication state
- Automatic reconnection when user logs in
- Proper cleanup when switching between admin/farmer modes

### ✅ Comprehensive Logging
- Detailed console logs for debugging
- Track socket connection status
- Monitor room joining/leaving operations

### ✅ Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for socket operations
- Graceful failure handling
- Prevents application crashes

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Maintains localStorage cleanup for legacy code
- Preserves existing functionality
- No breaking changes to existing components

## Testing Verification

### Admin Side
1. **Login as admin** → Socket connects and joins 'admin-room'
2. **Logout from admin** → Socket leaves room and disconnects properly
3. **Check server logs** → Should show "Client disconnected"

### Farmer Side
1. **Login as farmer** → Socket connects and joins 'farmer-{id}' room
2. **Logout from farmer** → Socket leaves room and disconnects properly
3. **Check server logs** → Should show "Client disconnected"

### Mode Switching
1. **Switch from admin to farmer mode** → Previous socket disconnects, new one connects
2. **Switch from farmer to admin mode** → Previous socket disconnects, new one connects

## Console Log Examples

### Successful Logout (Admin)
```
Logout: Leaving room: admin-room
SocketManager: Leaving room: admin-room
Logout: Disconnecting socket...
SocketManager: Disconnecting socket...
SocketManager: Socket disconnected successfully
AdminDashboard: Logging out...
```

### Successful Logout (Farmer)
```
Logout: Leaving room: farmer-{userId}
SocketManager: Leaving room: farmer-{userId}
Logout: Disconnecting socket...
SocketManager: Disconnecting socket...
SocketManager: Socket disconnected successfully
FarmerDashboard: Logging out...
```

## Security Benefits
- **Prevents socket connection leaks** after logout
- **Reduces server resource usage**
- **Improves application security** by properly cleaning up user sessions
- **Prevents unauthorized room access** after logout

The implementation ensures that Socket.IO clients are properly disconnected when users log out, maintaining security and preventing resource leaks on both client and server sides.
